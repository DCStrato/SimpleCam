###### Not much to say.   It works for me.   Hope it works for you.   

- Code is written in Visual Basic.  Why?  Because I had never written anything in VB.
- Code communicates with Lua Scripts in OBS.  How?  It just reads/writes to the same files.
- It supports five cameras.  Why 5?  That is how many I have.
- It supports 14 presets per scene/page, per camera.  Why 14?  It was about the right size window.

###### How to use? 

1. Install the SimpleCam.Lua Script to Program Files/obs-studio/data/obs-plugins/frontend-tools/scripts folder
2. Copy the other application files to a directory and build a shortcut to the SimpleCam.exe file.
3. Run the Exe file.  Open Settings.  Configure IP addresses or serial ports to cameras. 

##### That's it.
